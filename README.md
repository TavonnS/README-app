# README Generator App

## Description
This is an app that is run in the node environment which generates a README file in markdown syntax.  Using Inquirer, the app prompts a series of questions to build the readme, then codes the inputs to a finished file.  In this case, the product readme is written to the Build folder. 

## Installation
Node.js, Node Package Manager, and Inquirer must be installed to use this app.

## Usage/Screenshots/Video Link
To run this app, open the index.js file in the integrated terminal.  Type 'node index.js', and the prompts should appear in the command line. The prompt data gathered will be written to a readme file in markdown syntax.
